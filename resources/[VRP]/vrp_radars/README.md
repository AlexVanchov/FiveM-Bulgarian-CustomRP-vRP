If you want to add more radars do so by adding them on client.lua inside the radares local.

´´´
local radares = {
{x = 379.68807983398, y = -1048.3527832031, z = 29.250692367554},
{x = 379.68807983398, y = 1048.3527832031, z = 29.250692367554}
}
´´´

You can edit fines on line 11 of server.lua, change 120000 to whatever you want.

´´´
local multa = 120000

You can edit maxspeed in line 30 of client.lua
