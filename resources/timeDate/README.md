# FiveM_TimeAndDateDisplay
This was originally just a script that helped me in testing but I figured other people might want a time and date readout too. So I expanded it a bit and here you go. This script displays the time and date in the top right corner of the screen, and also displays the day of the week. You can also turn off any part that you don’t want to be displayed.

v0.2 Minor script optimization <br>
v0.3 Fixed issue with no display and reworked code <br>
v0.4 The text is now anchored to the right side so it doesn’t move the whole thing around a ton like it did before, and it now displays right next to the ‘FiveM’ watermark no matter which parts are turned off
